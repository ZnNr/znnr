Hi! I'm Zinnur, a Backend Developer with a core focus on Go and Java. My GitHub is a learning hub where I build pet projects, solve coding challenges for myself, and implement technical test assignments. I'm also expanding my low-level skills by learning C. My goal is to deepen my system design and engineering expertise through practical coding.
